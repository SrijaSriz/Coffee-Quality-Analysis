# Coffee Quality Analysis Using CQI Dataset

## 📊 Project Overview

This project utilizes data from the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)** to explore key factors that impact coffee quality. Through detailed sensory evaluations and analysis of processing and defect data, we aim to understand what makes coffee high-quality.

## 🏢 About CQI

The Coffee Quality Institute is a non-profit organization working to improve coffee quality worldwide through training, research, and certification. This dataset includes rich information on:

- Coffee genetics and soil types
- Processing methods
- Sensory evaluation (aroma, flavor, aftertaste, etc.)
- Defects (primary and secondary)

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Identify the main sensory attributes that influence overall quality (Total Cup Points).
2. Analyze correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and cup scores.
3. Study the impact of different defects on coffee quality.
4. Perform “What-If” scenarios using Power BI visualizations.

## 🗂️ Dataset Features

- **Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness**
- **Total Cup Points** – sum of the above attributes
- **Defects** – categorized as:
  - Category One: e.g., black, sour, insect-damaged beans
  - Category Two: e.g., over-fermentation, staleness, chemical taste

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Power BI
- Excel / CSV analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization and What-If analysis

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Strong positive correlation between aroma, flavor, and total cup points.
- Higher acidity and balance lead to better scores.
- Natural process coffees from Ethiopia scored highest on average.
